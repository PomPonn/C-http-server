## TODO (descending priority):
- maybe add some other ways to write to the response to avoid bloaty response building and unnecessary response line processing
- split 'utils' file into functional components
- tests
- build other base server implementations and let the user switch between them (multi-threaded, more performant, etc.)
- support more platforms (linux especially)?
## Issues:
- none

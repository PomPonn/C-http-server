## TODO (descending priority):
- update error message system
- maybe add some other ways to write to the response to avoid bloaty response building and unnecessary response line processing
- split 'utils' file into functional components
- make tests
- build more base server implementations and let the user switch between them (multi-threaded - more performant, etc.)
- support more platforms (linux especially)?
## Issues:
- none
